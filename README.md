# Google Fonts mixin
### Generate all of the required CSS for using Google Fonts in your project.

Why use a mixin? By storing all of our fonts in a handy variable (see `$font-list`) , we can update them whenever we need to and have our font rules update too. The mixin handles the CSS `@import` rule for you so you can fine tune things as much as you want.
